Malware is used to extract secured information from Users and is mostly used by Hackers for illegal activities.

Detection and Prevention to the entry of Malicious files into the computer system is necessary. Thus, using the techniques of Machine Learning our main idea is to design a model that could detect any Malicious Software that enters into the system prevent it from its operation. This repository contains the code files as well as the documentation of our project. For further details regarding our project, refer the documentation.
